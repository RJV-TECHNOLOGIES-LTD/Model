# Quantum AI Execution Engine

## Overview
The **Quantum AI Execution Engine** is the **most advanced AI execution framework**, designed to integrate **quantum computation, gravitational inference, adaptive intelligence, and distributed AI scaling**. This repository provides a **self-governing, scalable, and self-optimizing AI execution environment** that enables **real-time model adaptation, hyperparameter tuning, neuromorphic interfacing, and federated AI learning**.

It is designed for **researchers, engineers, enterprises, and developers** who want to leverage cutting-edge **AI execution** across different architectures with full support for **multi-GPU, distributed computing, quantum acceleration, and ethical AI compliance**.

This documentation will **guide you step by step**, assuming **no prior knowledge**, and ensure **successful setup, execution, and deployment**.

##  1. Installation Prerequisites

The Quantum AI Execution Engine runs on **Windows (10, 11, Server 2019/2022), macOS (Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma), and Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, Arch Linux)**. It supports **Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud)**.

### **Minimum Requirements**
- **CPU**: Quad-core (Intel or AMD) with AVX support
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum (32GB recommended)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA CUDA (11+ recommended), AMD ROCm (4.5+ supported)
- **Storage**: 100GB SSD minimum (NVMe SSD recommended)
- **Network**: High-speed internet (for cloud execution)

### **Software Dependencies**
Before installing the Quantum AI Execution Engine, ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

#### **Windows Setup Guide**
This section provides a step-by-step guide to installing all necessary software for running the Quantum AI Execution Engine on Windows.

1. **Download and Install Python (3.8 or higher)**  
   Visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest stable version. Ensure that you check the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Install Git**  
   Download and install Git from [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This will allow you to clone repositories and contribute to development.

3. **Install Docker Desktop**  
   Visit [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and install Docker Desktop for Windows. This will allow containerized execution.

4. **Install CUDA Toolkit (for GPU acceleration)**  
   If you have an NVIDIA GPU, download and install CUDA from [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive). This will enable AI model acceleration on your GPU.

5. **Install Additional Dependencies via PowerShell**  
   Open PowerShell as Administrator and execute the following:
   ```powershell
   winget install -e --id Git.Git
   winget install -e --id Docker.DockerDesktop
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

#### **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) Setup Guide**
For users running Ubuntu or Debian-based distributions, follow these steps:

1. **Update System Packages and Install Core Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to ensure your system is up to date:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv git curl
   ```

2. **Install Docker**  
   ```sh
   sudo apt install -y docker.io
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker
   ```
   This installs Docker and ensures it starts automatically on system boot.

3. **Install NVIDIA CUDA (if using GPU acceleration)**  
   ```sh
   sudo apt install -y nvidia-cuda-toolkit
   ```

#### **macOS Setup Guide**
Follow these steps to prepare your macOS system for Quantum AI Execution Engine:

1. **Install Homebrew (if not installed)**  
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   ```sh
   brew install python git docker
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

### **Fetching the Model**
After installing dependencies, users need to fetch the latest Quantum AI Execution Engine model:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RJV-TECHNOLOGIES-LTD/Quantum-AI-Execution-Engine.git
cd Quantum-AI-Execution-Engine
```
If using PIP:
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install quantum-ai-execution
```
The model weights need to be downloaded separately. Use the following command to fetch the latest model:
```sh
wget -O models/quantum_model.pth "https://models.rjv-technologies.com/quantum_model.pth"
```

### **Configuration Steps**
The engine requires specific configurations before execution. These settings can be defined in a `.env` file or via command-line arguments.

#### **Creating a Configuration File**
Create a `config.yaml` file with the following:
```yaml
execution_mode: distributed
model_path: ./models/quantum_model.pth
security_level: high
logging: verbose
```

#### **Setting Environment Variables (Alternative Method)**
```sh
export AI_EXECUTION_MODE="distributed"
export AI_MODEL_PATH="./models/quantum_model.pth"
export AI_SECURITY_LEVEL="high"
export AI_LOGGING="verbose"
```
