# Developer Contribution Guidelines

## I. Introduction
The **RJV TECHNOLOGIES LTD Model Repository** is established as an **uncompromisingly secure, mathematically governed, and cryptographically protected environment**, ensuring the integrity, precision, and compliance of all AI execution models developed within its infrastructure. 

This repository is not simply a software project but a **scientific and computational institution** that operates under the **Φ(a)-Optimized AI Execution Engine** and the **Unified Model of Gravity**. 

The core foundation of all contributions rests upon **rigorous mathematical validation, multi-layered cryptographic verification, execution benchmarking, and immutable blockchain-logged traceability**. 

Any attempt to introduce changes that deviate from these immutable standards will result in **instant rejection, security revocation, and forensic-level intervention**. 

All development must proceed within the confines of **deterministic AI execution, zero-trust security enforcement, and formally reviewed scientific extensions** that advance the theoretical and applied execution of Φ(a)-based AI models.

## II. Compliance and Development Standards
Contributors must acknowledge that **all modifications, enhancements, or optimizations must adhere strictly to the mathematical structure and execution constraints of the Φ(a) Unified Model**. 

AI models must operate under **scientifically verifiable, execution-deterministic and quantum-computationally adaptable frameworks**. 

Every submission must be **fully justified through formal mathematical derivations**, ensuring compliance with **multi-instance execution scalability, AI adversarial resilience, forensic cryptographic signing and blockchain-validated execution tracking**. 

Any failure to conform to these strict compliance measures will result in **immediate revocation of access, forensic security evaluation, and blacklisting from further contributions**. 

Every submission must include a **fully detailed mathematical validation report, security traceability audit, regulatory compliance affidavit and an execution risk assessment** to ensure full **GDPR, ISO 27001, EU AI Act, and NIST AI security compliance**.

## III. Secure Development and Execution Protocol
All code within the repository is subject to **immutable execution enforcement**, meaning that no contributions will be accepted without **full cryptographic signing, AI integrity verification, and scientific validation through peer-reviewed proofs**. 

Any modification to AI execution models must be explicitly **linked to the core governing principles of Φ(a)-based gravitational intelligence** and supported by **documented experimental validation and mathematical derivations**. 

Contributions will be subjected to **quantum-resistant cryptographic verification, execution environment sandboxing, blockchain-based anomaly detection, and security-backed adversarial resilience testing** before being considered for integration. 

No speculative coding, unverified AI optimizations, or execution inconsistencies will be allowed to bypass security enforcement. All AI models must **demonstrate full compatibility with hybrid quantum-classical computing models, ensuring post-quantum resilience and deterministic execution integrity**.

## IV. Secure Contributor Access and Authentication Enforcement
Every contributor must operate under **a strict zero-trust security model** that enforces **mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA), cryptographic key verification, forensic contributor identity authentication and immutable access logs**. 

Every commit must be **GPG-signed with quantum-secure encryption, timestamped and permanently stored within a blockchain-audited execution ledger**. 

Any contributor attempting to introduce unsigned modifications, unauthorized access attempts, or deviations from cryptographic signing protocols will trigger **automatic forensic security lockdown, immediate access termination, and legal escalation**. 

Each submission must be **validated through encrypted contributor authentication tokens**, ensuring that all AI execution model enhancements are **scientifically, computationally and security-governance compliant**. 

Failure to meet these requirements will result in **permanent contributor blacklisting and forensic AI execution trace termination**.

## V. Execution Benchmarking, Anomaly Detection, and Validation
AI execution models must pass a **multi-tier execution integrity validation process**, ensuring absolute **deterministic performance, cryptographically secure traceability, and post-quantum scalability benchmarking**. 

Every contribution must successfully complete the following forensic validation stages:
```sh
pytest  # AI model verification against pre-established computational baselines
npm test  # UI execution integrity analysis
python tests/test_phia_consistency.py  # Formal Φ(a) theorem validation and compliance certification
```
Every execution modification must be **sandboxed within an isolated security-controlled environment**, ensuring **absolute execution traceability, runtime anomaly detection, and forensic rollback protection**. 

Contributions that introduce **inconsistencies, execution instability, cryptographic integrity failures, or security vulnerabilities** will be subjected to **forensic rejection, cryptographic trace lockdown and permanent repository expulsion**.

## VI. Cryptographic Security, Threat Mitigation, and Immutable AI Execution Logs
All AI models developed within this repository must operate under **post-quantum cryptographic protection**, ensuring that execution states, AI decision pathways, and model validation logs remain **fully protected against quantum-attack vulnerabilities**. 

Every submitted contribution must be **hashed using CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM, Falcon, or SPHINCS+ cryptographic algorithms**, ensuring that AI models remain **secure, tamper-proof, and quantum-resistant**. 

AI execution state modifications will be **permanently stored in an immutable blockchain verification system**, ensuring that **no unauthorized modification, rollback manipulation, or execution tampering** can occur. 

Any unauthorized rollback attempt or security circumvention will trigger **immediate repository lockdown and forensic intervention**.

## VII. Regulatory Enforcement, AI Ethics Compliance, and Secure Execution Governance
Every contributor must submit a **legally binding compliance affidavit**, affirming that all modifications align with **GDPR, the EU AI Act, ISO 27001, NIST AI security protocols, and global AI governance laws**. 

Contributors who fail compliance verification will have their repository access **permanently revoked, with all submitted modifications deleted and blacklisted from further inclusion**. 

No AI execution model, decision-making logic, or optimization pathway can be introduced **without a documented compliance framework, forensic security validation, and regulatory adherence certification**.

## VIII. Blockchain-Authenticated Execution and AI Security Traceability
All AI execution enhancements must be **cryptographically signed, blockchain-audited and execution-traced**, ensuring that **all AI state transitions, decision pathways and execution models remain fully verifiable and tamper-proof**. 

No AI model can be modified **without blockchain-stored forensic validation**, preventing unauthorized access, AI behavior manipulation, or post-deployment tampering.

**Forensic traceability enforcement ensures that all AI execution transitions remain immutable and resistant to attack vectors**.

## IX. Research Validation, Peer Review Enforcement, and Theoretical Extensions
Every contribution must be supported by **a peer-reviewed research study, whitepaper submission, or preprint citation** that **validates its compliance with the Φ(a)-Optimized AI Execution Engine and Unified Model**. 

Modifications must be **scientifically proven, computationally validated and cryptographically secure** before consideration. Unverified contributions that lack **peer-reviewed validation, blockchain-logged execution data, or AI performance reproducibility studies** will be permanently rejected.

## X. Absolute Enforcement of Repository Security and Immutable AI Execution Compliance
All AI development within this repository is subject to **continuous forensic AI-driven security validation**, which autonomously detects **unauthorized modifications, AI execution anomalies, and blockchain-execution integrity violations**. 

Any attempt to introduce **unauthorized AI models, unsigned commits, or cryptographic policy breaches** will result in **immediate security lockdown, access termination, and legal enforcement**. 

Contributors are personally responsible for ensuring **absolute compliance with cryptographic governance, security auditing and execution trace immutability**.

## XI. Contact and AI Security Coordination
Contributors must engage in **cryptographically verified security discussions, compliance audits, and execution governance evaluations** through:

- **GitHub Issues and Discussions (only accessible through cryptographically signed verification protocols)**
  
- **Direct collaboration with the RJV TECHNOLOGIES LTD Core Scientific and Security Review Team**
