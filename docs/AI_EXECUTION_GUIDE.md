# AI Execution Guide

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Execution Engine**:  
   ```bash
   python src/core/ai_execution_engine.py
   ```

## Best Practices
- Use **virtual environments** for dependency management.
- Optimize execution for **multi-GPU** environments.
- Always test execution with **benchmarking tools**.
