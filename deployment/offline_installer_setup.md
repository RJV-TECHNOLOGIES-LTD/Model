## **Overview**
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up **Unified Model AI** in **offline environments** with **fully automated installation**. The setup includes handling **dependencies**, configuring **AI model execution**, and ensuring **self-healing mechanisms** to guarantee a seamless offline experience.

### **Required Resources**
1. **Offline Package Directory**: Download all dependencies, including **Python packages** and **Docker images**.
2. **Pre-Trained AI Models**: Ensure your **Unified Model AI** (gravitational, quantum, tensor models) is ready.
3. **Offline Tools**: Use **USB drives** or **local servers** to transfer files to the offline machine.

---

## **Step 1: Download Required Dependencies**

On a connected machine, perform the following steps to **download all dependencies** for offline installation.

1. **Create a directory to store dependencies**:
   ```bash
   mkdir offline_packages
   ```

2. **Download Python dependencies** from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip download -r requirements.txt -d ./offline_packages
   ```

3. **Download pre-trained AI models**:
   Ensure that you have the AI model file(s) in **ONNX, TensorFlow, or PyTorch** format. If your model is stored in the cloud, use `aws`, `gsutil`, or `azcopy` commands to download the models:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp s3://your-ai-models-bucket/model.onnx ./offline_packages/
   ```

4. **Download Docker images** if required for offline use:
   ```bash
   docker pull your-ai-model-image:latest
   docker save your-ai-model-image:latest -o ./offline_packages/ai_model_image.tar
   ```

5. **Transfer all the files** (offline packages, model files, and Docker images) to the target offline machine.

## **Step 2: Install Dependencies Offline**

After transferring the required files to the offline machine, you can proceed with the **offline installation**.

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install --no-index --find-links=offline_packages -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Docker images**:
   ```bash
   docker load -i ./offline_packages/ai_model_image.tar
   ```

3. **Check installation**:
   After installing, verify that all Python dependencies are correctly installed:
   ```bash
   pip freeze
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Setup AI Model Execution Environment**

1. **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed**. If Docker is not available, you can install it manually using the downloaded installation packages.
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose
   ```

2. **Start AI Execution using Docker Compose**:
   Once Docker is installed, navigate to the **deployment folder** and run:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/deploy
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

   - This will launch the **Unified Model AI** and start the containers required for execution.

---

## **Step 4: Monitoring and Auto-Restart for Offline Execution**

Ensure that **AI execution is resilient** and **self-healing**:

1. **Setup AI execution monitoring**:
   Create a cron job to **monitor AI execution** every minute and restart if necessary.

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line to check the AI execution container and restart it if stopped:
   ```bash
   * * * * * /usr/bin/docker ps | grep ai_execution || /usr/local/bin/docker-compose restart
   ```

2. **Create a health check script** for offline AI execution:
   ```bash
   # monitor_ai_health.sh
   if ! docker ps | grep -q "ai_execution"; then
     echo "‚ùå AI Execution stopped unexpectedly! Restarting..."
     docker-compose restart
   fi
   ```

3. **Run the monitoring script**:
   ```bash
   bash /path/to/monitor_ai_health.sh
   ```

---

## **Step 5: Configuring Security & Execution Integrity**

1. **Restrict access** to the deployment directories:
   ```bash
   chmod 700 /path/to/deploy/
   chmod 600 /path/to/logs/*
   ```

2. **Configure firewall rules** to ensure secure access:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp  # Allow AI execution port
   ```

3. **Enable encrypted communication** and **restricted access control**.

---

## **Step 6: Final Verification**

1. **Test AI inference execution**:
   After successfully starting the containers, test the AI model execution by sending a sample request to the AI inference endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict -d '{"input": [1, 2, 3, 4]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

2. **Verify AI model health**:
   Check the status of the Docker containers to ensure **AI execution is up and running**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
