## Data Security
- Ensure encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Utilize secure authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2.

## Secure Model Deployment
- Run models in isolated environments using Docker or Kubernetes.
- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like Bandit and Trivy.

## Access Controls
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized access.
- Use environment variables for handling sensitive credentials.
